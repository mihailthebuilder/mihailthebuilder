## Read this before checking the repos

**_This is my personal profile._** I keep my professional work in different profiles, based on what each employer prefers.

**_The code in these repos tends to be very different than what I write at work._** I use the right tools for the job, whether it's
programming language, framework, testing, infrastructure, you name it.
