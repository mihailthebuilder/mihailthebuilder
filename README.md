Howdy! A few things to note before you check out my repos.

**_This is my personal profile._** My professional contributions lie in separate profiles, as per the employers' requirements.

**_The code in these repos tends to be very different than what I write at work._** I use the right tools for the job, whether it's
programming language, framework, testing, infrastructure, you name it.

Some highlights from this profile:

- [HEX to Tailwind](https://github.com/mihailthebuilder/hex-tailwind/) - small web app that converts your HEX code to the closest color in the Tailwind color palette. Ranked #2 on Google search results and #1 on Bing.
